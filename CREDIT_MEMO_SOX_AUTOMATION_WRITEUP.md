## Comprehensive Feature Documentation

---

## Executive Summary

The Credit Memo SOX Automation Tool is an intelligent, AI-powered solution designed to streamline the validation and compliance review of credit memo transactions against SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) audit requirements. This tool automates the labor-intensive process of credit memo validation, reducing manual review time from 3-5 hours per batch to minutes, while simultaneously improving accuracy and providing comprehensive audit trails.

By combining rule-based validation logic with advanced AI analysis, organizations can now efficiently process high volumes of credit memos, identify compliance violations, assess risk levels, and generate detailed reports with actionable insights—all through an intuitive web-based interface.

---

## Problem Statement

Credit memo processing represents a significant control point in the financial transaction lifecycle, particularly for SOX compliance. Traditional validation approaches involve:

- **Manual Review Burden**: Each credit memo must be individually reviewed against approval matrices, timelines, and authorization rules
- **Time Consumption**: Audit teams spend 3-5 hours reviewing and validating batches of credit memos
- **Error Susceptibility**: Manual processes are prone to human error, inconsistency, and oversight
- **Lack of Documentation**: Limited audit trails make it difficult to demonstrate compliance during audits
- **Scalability Issues**: Organizations struggle to handle high-volume credit memo processing without significant resource investment
- **Compliance Gaps**: Missing or inadequate approvals may go undetected until audit findings emerge

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. **Data Input Layer**
- **File Upload**: Support for XLSX and XLS credit memo files
- **Sheet Detection**: Automatic or manual selection of data sheets
- **Data Preview**: Real-time preview with validation before processing
- **Configuration Controls**: Adjustable parameters for SLA thresholds and approval requirements

#### 2. **Validation Engine (ValidateCredit Class)**

The core validation logic operates through the `ValidateCredit` class with the following methodology:

**Row-Level Validation Process:**
```
For each credit memo row:
├── Extract transaction details (Memo ID, Customer, Date, Amount, Reason, etc.)
├── Determine Reason Class (Promotional, Contract, Other)
├── Apply Approval Level Rules
│   ├── Check for Required Approvers based on reason class and amount
│   ├── Validate actual approvers against matrix requirements
│   ├── Identify missing approval levels
│   └── Track approval chain completeness
├── Check Timeline Compliance
│   ├── Calculate business days between Approval Date and Credit Memo Date
│   ├── Compare against SLA threshold
│   ├── Flag if over SLA
│   └── Generate timeline status
├── Determine Risk Level
│   ├── High Risk: Missing approvals AND over SLA (2+ violations)
│   ├── Medium Risk: One violation type present
│   ├── Low Risk: All requirements met
├── Assess SOX Status
│   ├── SOX Compliant: All approvals present, within SLA
│   ├── SOX Violation: Missing approvals OR over SLA
├── Generate Violation Reasons (with pipe-separated descriptions)
├── Count Violation Count (0, 1, or 2+)
└── Format output for display and export
```

**Approval Matrix Logic:**
- **Promotional Credits**: Customer Analyst (Level 1) → Credit Supervisor (Level 2) → Finance Manager (Level 3)
- **Contract Adjustments**: Customer Analyst (Level 1) → Credit Supervisor (Level 2) → Finance Manager (Level 3) → Treasurer (Level 4)
- **Other Credits**: Customer Analyst (Level 1) → Credit Supervisor (Level 2) → Finance Manager (Level 3)

**Violation Detection:**
- Missing required approval levels
- Approval chain gaps (e.g., Level 3 present but Level 1 missing)
- SLA timeline violations (exceeding business day threshold)
- Designation mismatches (wrong person in approval role)

#### 3. **AI Analysis Layer**

#### 4. **Data Transformation & Display**

**Display DataFrame Processing:**
```
1. Column Reordering (for optimal readability):
   - Row #, Memo, Customer Name, Date Of Approval, Cm Date
   - Reason, Reason Class, Amount, Approver, Approver Designation
   - Required Approval Level, Final Approver, SOX Status
   - Risk Level, Timeline Status, Violation Reason, Violation Count
   - Missing Approvals, Business Days

2. Date Formatting:
   - Remove timestamp (00:00:00) for cleaner display
   - Preserve date accuracy for calculations

3. Amount Formatting:
   - Apply thousand separator (comma) formatting
   - Maintain numeric accuracy for calculations

4. Row Numbering:
   - Manual "Row #" column (1 to N)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: File Upload Fails**
- **Cause**: Unsupported file format or corruption
- **Solution**: Ensure file is .XLSX or .XLS, not CSV or PDF
- **Alternative**: Try opening file in Excel, save as XLSX, retry

**Issue 2: "No data found" or "Empty results"**
- **Cause**: Selected sheet has no data or wrong column names
- **Solution**: Preview data before processing, check for merged cells
- **Alternative**: Use "New Analysis" to reset and try different sheet

**Issue 3: AI Features Disabled**
- **Cause**: Azure credentials not found or invalid
- **Solution**: 
  - Local: Check .env file in parent directory
  - Cloud: Verify secrets added in Streamlit Cloud settings
  - Verify API key and endpoint are correct

**Issue 4: Export File Contains Errors**
- **Cause**: Data corruption or formatting issue during export
- **Solution**: Clear session, reload data, attempt export again
- **Alternative**: Try different export format (CSV instead of Excel)

**Issue 5: Filters Not Working**
- **Cause**: Filter applied with no matching results
- **Solution**: Clear filters, verify data exists for filter criteria
- **Verification**: Check row count before and after filter
