---

## Opening

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:15]**

"Hi everyone, and welcome to our AI-powered Credit Memo SOX Automation tool.

In today's compliance-driven landscape, credit memo validation is critical, but often manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. This demo walks you through our AI automation solution that makes credit memo validation faster, smarter, and more accurate for audit, compliance, and risk teams. 

In this demo, we automate credit memo compliance checking in minutes. Upload your credit memo file, let AI validate against approval matrices, detect SOX violations, assess risk levels, and instantly export results with executive insights and visual dashboards—all ready for auditing.

Let's get started."

## Part 1: Application Home & Setup

**[HOME PAGE & CONFIGURATION - 0:15-0:45]**

"Let's start with the home page. Here on the left sidebar, you'll see our configuration panel. This is where we set up the validation parameters.

First, we have the SLA Threshold in business days—the standard is 5 days, which is our default. This determines if credit memos meet our timeline compliance requirements. We also define the threshold for high-risk classification—by default, 2 or more violations triggers high risk status.

Below that, we can customize keywords for different credit memo types. Here we see 'promotional, promotion' for promotional credits, and 'contract' for contract adjustments. You can customize these based on your business logic.

At the bottom is our 'New Analysis' button, which clears the session and prepares for a fresh batch.

The main content area shows file upload instructions. Let's begin by uploading our credit memo Excel file."

---

## Part 2: File Upload & Data Preview

**[FILE UPLOAD - 0:45-1:15]**

"Let's drag and drop our credit memo file here. We can upload XLSX or XLS files up to 200MB.

[FILE UPLOADING...]

Great! The file is uploaded. Now we get a quick preview of the first several rows. Look at the columns: we can see Memo ID, Customer Name, Date of Approval, Credit Memo Date, Reason, Approver, Approver Designation, and Required Approval Level.

Notice at the top there's an automatic sheet detection. If your file has multiple sheets, you can select which one to analyze. Our AI-powered system reads and validates the data structure automatically.

You can see in the status indicator: 'File uploaded. Processing...' Let's check our AI credentials. Our AI features are enabled—that means we can leverage GPT-4 powered insights during this analysis.

Perfect! The data preview looks good. We're ready to proceed with validation."

---

## Part 3: Running Validation & Initial Results

**[VALIDATION EXECUTION - 1:15-2:00]**

"Now let's click 'Run Validation' to begin the automated compliance checking.

[PROCESSING...]

Behind the scenes, our validation engine is doing several things simultaneously:

First, it's applying our approval matrix rules. For each credit memo, it checks whether all required approvers are present based on the credit memo reason and amount.

Second, it's calculating timeline compliance. It measures the business days between the approval date and credit memo date, comparing against our 5-day SLA threshold.

Third, it's determining risk levels. If a memo is missing approvals AND over SLA, it's flagged as High Risk. If it has one violation type, it's Medium Risk. If everything checks out, it's Low Risk.

Finally, it's generating violation descriptions—clear, auditor-friendly explanations of what went wrong.

[RESULTS APPEAR...]

Here's our analysis complete! Look at the summary cards:
- Compliant: 39 memos, that's 39% of our batch
- Violations: 61 memos, representing 61% of our batch  
- High Risk: 17 items flagged for immediate attention
- Total Amount: $6.1 million in credit memos processed

This is our instant snapshot of compliance status."

---

## Part 4: Results Table & Color Coding

**[DETAILED RESULTS TABLE - 2:00-2:45]**

"Now let's look at our detailed results table. This is where all the magic happens.

Each row represents a credit memo with 15+ columns of validation data. Notice the color coding:

The 'Violation Reason' column shows gray backgrounds for memos with no violations. These are compliant items—everything passed.

When you see red backgrounds, that indicates exactly 1 violation was detected. For example, 'Missing Approval: Level 3 Missing' is shown in red. This helps you quickly spot single-issue items.

Blue backgrounds indicate 2 or more violations combined. For example, 'Missing Approval: Level 2 Missing | SLA Exceeded: Over 5 days' shows two separate compliance issues on the same memo. These are your most critical items.

You can scroll through all columns: Row Number, Memo ID, Customer Name, Approval Date, Credit Memo Date, Reason, Approval Status, Risk Level, and the Violation descriptions.

Notice at the top, there's real-time filtering. You can filter by Memo ID with text search, by SOX Status—Compliant or Violation—or by Risk Level: Low, Medium, or High. All filters work together for quick analysis.

Let's filter by Risk Level = High to focus on our most critical items."

---

## Part 5: Interactive Filtering

**[FILTERING - 2:45-3:15]**

"Perfect. Now we're seeing only the 17 high-risk items. Notice the row numbers have updated to show only filtered results. Each of these memos has critical issues requiring immediate attention.

Let's look at a few examples:
- This memo is missing both Level 1 and Level 3 approvals while being over SLA
- This one has a designation mismatch—wrong person in the approval role
- This one exceeded the SLA by significant business days

The color coding makes it instantly obvious which are most critical. All the blue-background cells represent memos with multiple violation types.

Now, instead of manually reviewing each item, let's leverage our AI Assistant. Notice on the right sidebar, we have our AI Assistant panel. Since we've loaded data, it's now active and ready to help."

---

## Part 6: AI Quick-Action Buttons

**[AI INSIGHTS - 3:15-4:00]**

"Below the results table, you'll see our Quick AI Insights section with four powerful buttons. Let's explore these.

First, let's click 'Explain Violations.' This button analyzes all SOX violations in our current dataset and provides AI-generated explanations.

[AI PROCESSING...]

Here's what the AI generated: 'Found potential compliance issues requiring review. 61 violation(s) detected. 17 high-risk item(s) need attention.'

The AI has summarized the key violations, identified patterns, and explained the compliance impact. This insight is automatically added to our chat history.

Now let's try 'High-Risk Items.' This analyzes the most critical memos and recommends immediate actions.

[AI RESPONSE...]

The AI explains which approval levels are missing most frequently, what the severity is, and what immediate actions should be taken. This is actionable intelligence generated instantly.

Next is 'Timeline Analysis.' This focuses on SLA violations and workflow bottlenecks.

[AI ANALYSIS...]

Perfect. The AI identifies that our average delay is 3 business days over SLA, highlights which approvers are causing bottlenecks, and suggests process improvements.

Finally, let's click 'Generate Summary' for an executive-level overview.

[AI SUMMARY...]

This generates a concise summary perfect for leadership review—compliance percentage, risk breakdown, and top 3 strategic recommendations for improving our credit memo process."

---

## Part 7: Interactive AI Chat

**[AI CHAT - 4:00-4:45]**

"But the AI doesn't stop there. You can also chat directly with the AI Assistant in the sidebar.

Let's ask a custom question: 'What are the most common reasons for violations?'

[TYPING...]

[AI RESPONSE...]

The AI instantly analyzes our data and responds with specific patterns: 'The most common violations are missing Level 3 approvals (42%), followed by SLA timeouts (38%), and designation mismatches (20%). High-value memos show the highest violation rate.'

This is contextual analysis based on your specific data—not generic responses, but insights tailored to your batch.

Let's ask another: 'Which customers have the most violations?'

[AI RESPONSE...]

The AI provides a ranked list of customers with the highest violation counts and their specific issues. This helps you identify problematic patterns and customer-specific risks.

The conversation history is maintained throughout your session, so you can explore multiple angles of your data without re-uploading or reprocessing."

---

## Part 8: Multi-Format Export

**[EXPORTS - 4:45-5:30]**

"When you're ready to document your findings, we offer three export formats.

First, 'Download CSV.' This exports the current view—including any filters you've applied—as comma-separated values. Perfect for quick data import into other systems or offline analysis.

Next, 'Download Excel.' This creates a professionally formatted Excel workbook with:
- Color-coded cells matching your preview (gray for no violations, red for single violations, blue for multiple)
- Frozen header row for easy navigation
- Auto-filter enabled so you can sort and filter in Excel
- Optimized column widths for readability
- Complete audit trail included

Let's see what the Excel export looks like:

[EXCEL OPENS...]

Look at this! Professional formatting, all columns properly aligned, and the Violation Reason column color-coded exactly as displayed in the preview. This is audit-ready documentation. You can sort by SOX Status, Risk Level, or any column. The filters persist exactly as you set them.

Finally, 'Download PDF (with Charts).' This generates a comprehensive report including:
- Summary page with compliance statistics
- Visual dashboards: SOX Status pie chart and Risk Level distribution
- Detailed memo listing with all key fields
- Professional formatting suitable for stakeholder review

Perfect for presentations or audit submissions."

## Part 9: Session Management & Re-analysis

**[SESSION MANAGEMENT - 5:30-6:00]**

"One more powerful feature: you can process multiple batches without reloading the application.

After reviewing your first batch, simply click 'New Analysis' in the sidebar. This clears your current results and chat history, but maintains your configuration settings. You're immediately ready to upload and validate your next batch of credit memos.

This makes the tool perfect for processing daily or weekly batches. You maintain consistency in your parameters while moving efficiently through your workload.

And if you need to adjust your SLA threshold or keywords between batches, you can do so in the sidebar at any time. Your new settings apply immediately to the next analysis."
